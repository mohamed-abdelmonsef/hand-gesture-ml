Hand Gesture Recognition using MediaPipe and Machine Learning  This project uses MediaPipe to detect hand landmarks in real-time and a trained machine learning model (e.g., XGBoost, Random Forest, or SVM) to classify hand gestures. It includes preprocessing, gesture stabilization with a sliding window, and real-time prediction display.
